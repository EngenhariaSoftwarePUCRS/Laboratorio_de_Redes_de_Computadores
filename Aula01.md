Wireshark “protocol” column) in your trace file: TCP, QUIC, HTTP, DNS, UDP,
TLSv1.2?
R: ARP, HTTP, ICMP, RARP, SSDP, TCP, TLSv1.2

2. How long did it take from when the HTTP GET message was sent until the HTTP
OK reply was received? (By default, the value of the Time column in the packetlisting window is the amount of time, in seconds, since Wireshark tracing began.
(If you want to display the Time field in time-of-day format, select the Wireshark
View pull down menu, then select Time Display Format, then select Time-of-day.)
